# Simu_Fitts

Python files which run some Fitts experience simulations and predict movement time and optimal error rate. Run ```simulation.py``` to get movement time predictions, and ```minimize1.py``` or ```minimize2.py``` to get optimal error rates. Modify the parameters at the top of each file to get different results.
